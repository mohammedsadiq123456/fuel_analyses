The Fuel Analyses Project is designed to perform predictive analytics and data visualization on fuel efficiency data. This project leverages Python and data science techniques to analyze fuel consumption trends, detect outliers, and implement Polynomial Regression for predictive modeling. The dataset undergoes thorough Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), including outlier detection using the IQR method, to ensure accurate insights.
